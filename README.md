#Modified to generate 2D 1024x1024 mask of phantom

iphantom1.ipynb is a playground, with subroutines spelled out explicitly for modification as desired

iphantom2.ipynb uses a version of derenzo_phantom loaded from Google drive

iphantom3.ipynb clones derenzo_phantom from github and uses that
